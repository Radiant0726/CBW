# CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking
This is the official implementation of our paper 'CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking'. This work is a journal extension of our preliminary [conference paper (ICASSP'21)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11607.pdf). This research project is developed based on Python 3 and Pytorch, created by [Yiming Li](https://liyiming.tech/) and [Kaiying Yan](https://github.com/Radiant0726).

The codes will be released very soon. Please refer to the [codes](https://github.com/zhaitongqing233/Backdoor-attack-against-speaker-verification) of implementing our watermarking method (contained in our conference version) for some insights.
